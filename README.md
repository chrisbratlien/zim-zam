"apple is a fruit" is encoded as 5-4-6, but this knowledge is not tightly coupled to the English language. The 5-4-6 relationship remains true in whatever language.

It only has the appearance of English when we throw the concept of 1 (in english) at it.

5<sub>1</sub>-4<sub>1</sub>-6<sub>1</sub> => "apple is a fruit"

5<sub>2</sub>-4<sub>2</sub>-6<sub>2</sub> => "eple er en frukt"


Hopefully this model of encoding knowledge can reduce the burden of translating knowledge to different languages. Let's say an expert on a topic contributes some knowledge, but that expert speaks a different language than a person seeking that knowledge, etc.

That's the idea I'm hoping to explore with this
