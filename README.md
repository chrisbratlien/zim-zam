language-agnostic knowledge-base

The zam table. Written interpretations of concepts in a given language

"apple is a fruit" is encoded as 5-4-6, but this knowledge is not coupled to the English language. The 5-4-6 relationship remains true in whatever language.

It only has the appearance of English when we throw the concept of 1 (in english) at it.

5,,1-4,,1-6,,1 => "apple is a fruit"

5,,2-4,,2-6,,2 => "eple er en frukt"


Hopefully this model of encoding knowledge can reduce the burden of translating knowledge to different languages. Let's say an expert on a topic contributes some knowledge, but that expert speaks a different language than a person seeking that knowledge, etc.

That's the idea I'm hoping to explore with this
